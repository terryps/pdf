## Usage
### File Structure
DearFlip, also known as dFlip, flipbook plugin is jQuery based. Basically you can copy the files in folder to your working directory. We recommend copying the whole dflip folder as it is.

```
dflip/
  ├── css/
  ├── fonts/(fonts folder are not used since 2.0)
  ├── images/
  ├── sound/
  └── js/
      └── libs/
```
```
// In older versions, before v1.4.2, dflip folder was expected in the root where the html file is served.
// if not the location was required to be indicated.
// As of version 1.4.2, (not required in normal conditions, will be auto-detected)
var dFlipLocation = "http://www.yoursite.com/dflip/";
```
